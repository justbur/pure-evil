* pure evil
A minor mode for Emacs 

** What?
Temporarily remove keymaps with higher priority than the standard evil-mode
keymaps.

** Why?
 1. You want to search for/select/copy some text in a buffer easily, in a magit
    buffer for instance
 2. You want to use a standard binding that's being shadowed.
 3. Some minor mode is driving you crazy.
** How? 
Install pure-evil.el in your path and toggle using =pure-evil-mode=.
